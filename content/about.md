Dave Russell is a software developer, exploring and enjoying the [go](https://golang.org) language and community.  This site is a place for me to experiment with [hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com); and eventually sharing topics worthy of being a blog post.
  
Thanks for stopping by...
