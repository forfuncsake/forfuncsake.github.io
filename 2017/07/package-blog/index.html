  <p>Every blog needs a first post, and what better subject to record than the birth of this blog.</p>

<p>Last weekend, I was reading a particular <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/6m10xf/clean_http_handlers_in_go/">reddit post</a> and noticed the OPs username <code>forfunc</code>. I&rsquo;ve also been watching (and loving!) <a href="https://twitter.com/francesc">@francesc</a>&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/justforfunc">JustForFunc</a> channel. I like the wordplay and thought myself very clever indeed when I came up with &ldquo;for func sake&rdquo;&hellip;</p>

<p>It just so happened that the username was available in the places I want to use it; and I&rsquo;ve been less than thrilled with my previous username choice(s)&hellip; so I spent an hour or so creating new accounts across the web. Step 1, done.</p>

<p>With the username locked in - I needed a project for it. I&rsquo;ve been writing a bit of go for my job and soaking in as much as I can from various blogs, subreddits, GopherFest livestreams, GopherCon talk videos and open source projects - and I feel like the time has come to contribute something back. I don&rsquo;t know what that contribution will be yet - but I figure that when I do find my pet project, I&rsquo;m going to want to share it - so Step 2 is the blog.</p>

<p>What follows is a (probably not as brief as it should be) overview of how I got from that point to publishing this post:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to start a blog&hellip; so now what?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At around 21:00 yesterday (AEST), I decided to google &ldquo;host blog on github&rdquo;. Turns out.. it&rsquo;s a thing and wasn&rsquo;t about to break any new ground. I discovered that Jekyll is the &ldquo;default&rdquo; static generator provided by GitHub Pages - then remembered reading something about Hugo a few months back. Considering I&rsquo;m all in on go right now, I knew I should dig deeper.</p>

<p>At 21:15 I was here -&gt; <a href="https://opensource.com/article/17/5/hugo-vs-jekyll">https://opensource.com/article/17/5/hugo-vs-jekyll</a><br />
At 21:20, here -&gt; <a href="https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/jekyll-ghpages-to-hugo-netlify/">https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/jekyll-ghpages-to-hugo-netlify/</a> and thinking that I might need to look up netlify, having never heard of it before.</p>

<p>It quickly became clear that Hugo was going to be my tool of choice - and github pages would be my publisher to start with.</p>

<p>By 22:00, I had just viewed a &ldquo;working&rdquo; local site from following the <a href="https://gohugo.io/overview/quickstart/">Hugo Quickstart Guide</a>. I also couldn&rsquo;t help but notice that while it walks the reader through setting up on GitHub Pages&hellip; the guide itself is deployed with Netlify&hellip; [pause for effect] interesting.</p>

<p>Pause is also what happened to the site - it was time to get some sleep.</p>

<p>Around 21:00 this evening I was ready to resume; but I was also in the middle of grinding dailes in Hearthstone&hellip; because, double gold!</p>

<p>By 21:50 I had chosen an initial theme, <a href="https://github.com/alanorth/hugo-theme-bootstrap4-blog">Bootstrap4</a>, started config customisation  and realised that I&rsquo;m probably going to want a disqus account - which I finally set up while in the middle of typing out this sentence.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s now 23:30 and again time for me to sleep - so I&rsquo;ll wrap up here - noting that my next post will be the step-by-step of how I publish to GH Pages.</p>
